# Mitron-Bank---Project

### About Mitron Bank
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market

### Objective Of The Project
The objective is to analyze this data and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide Mitron Bank in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends.

### Problem Statment

- Demographic classification: Classify the customers based on available demography such as age group, gender, occupation etc. and provide insights based on them.

- Avg income utilisation %: Find the average income utilisation % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). This will be your key metric. The higher the average income utilisation %, the more is their likelihood to use credit cards.

- Spending Insights: Where do people spend money the most? Does it have any impact due to occupation, gender, city, age etc.? This can help you to add relevant credit card features for specific target groups.

- Key Customer Segments: By doing above, you should be able to identify and profile key customer segments that are likely to be the highest-value users of the new credit cards. This includes understanding their demographics, spending behaviours, and financial preferences.

- Credit Card Feature Recommendations: Provide recommendations on what key features should be included in the credit card which will improve the likelihood of credit card usage. This should be backed by the insights from data provided and also some secondary research on the internet for this.

### Recomendation for Next Credit Card

To improve the likelihood of credit card usage among the identified target customers (salaried employees, self-employed individuals, and freelancers), consider incorporating the following key features in the credit card:

#### Tailored Rewards Program:
Create a rewards program that aligns with the spending patterns of salaried employees, self-employed individuals, and freelancers. This could include cash back on common categories of spending such as groceries, dining, and business-related expenses.

Flexible Payment Options:
Offer flexible payment plans to accommodate different income structures. This could include customizable monthly payment options, allowing users to adjust their payment schedule based on their cash flow.

#### Expense Tracking and Budgeting Tools:
Provide built-in tools or partner with budgeting apps to help users track their expenses, categorize spending, and set budget goals. This can be particularly beneficial for freelancers and self-employed individuals managing variable income.

#### Low Annual Fees and Interest Rates:
Keep annual fees competitive and offer reasonable interest rates to attract and retain customers. Consider providing introductory offers, lower rates for loyal customers, or special promotions for specific spending categories.

#### Contactless and Mobile Payments:
Ensure the credit card supports contactless payments and integrates with popular mobile payment platforms. This adds convenience for users who prefer digital and contactless transactions.

#### Security Features:
Implement advanced security features such as fraud alerts, biometric authentication, and virtual card numbers to enhance the safety of transactions. Communicate these security measures to build trust among users.
